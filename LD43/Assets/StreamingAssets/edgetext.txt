1S2C
[
	That street seem really dangerous: I may walk by unnoticed if I am alone, but if we are more we'll have to fight for our lives.
]

2S3C
[
	This way seems pretty safe : 2 of us could remain unseen, but 3 or more would drow the attention and we would be in for a fight.
]

3S4C
[
	I guess walking a street in a group of three is the best we can hope this times. It doesn't get less risky than that.
]

1S2D
[
	Someone small can still sneak through but the foes are so numerous that the only hope to have a party traverse is for someone to make a diversion.
]

0S1C
[
	There is nowhere to hide, we must fight to progress ! But it should be easy. Provided you're not alone.
]

Eglise
[
	The churches are holy protections are falling, one after an other, but this one stands. We might find a priest inside.
]

Soldat
[
	I can hear the echos of the ring steel makes when it hit bones. One of our man is still fighting there.
]

Fight
[
	The corruption of the city is so advanced we will have to cleanse this place to earn an ever so brief relief.
]

Gate
[
	The bridge was lifted to prevent the contagion. Trying to protect ourselves, we closed our only way to freedom.
]

Key
[
	Here lived the keeper of the Bridge. If God is willing, we will be able to lower it. If God is willing, our salvation is here.

Wood
[
	A wooden watchtower has fallen, blocking the way. A bit of fire and a bit of time could clear enough of the wreckage for us to make it through.
]

Small passage
[
	Some floating debris make a precarious bridge. Maybe someone light enough could walk to the other side, but anyone of normal stature would surely drow.
]

Unholy
[
	Some kind of unholy blight seem to have overtaken this path. Only a holy man could free the way.
