0S1C
[
	There is nowhere to hide, we must fight to progress ! But it should be easy. Provided you're not alone.
]

1S2C
[
	That street seem really dangerous: I may walk by unnoticed if I am alone, but if we are more we'll have to fight for our lives.
]

2S3C
[
	This way seems pretty safe : 2 of us could remain unseen, but 3 or more would draw the attention and we would be in for a fight.
]

3S4C
[
	I guess walking a street in a group of three is the best we can hope this times. It doesn't get less risky than that.
]

0S1D
[
	We stand no chance if one of us doesn't lure the hord of enemy's hord out of the way.
]

1S2D
[
	Someone small can still sneak through but the foes are so numerous that the only hope to have a party traverse is for someone to make a diversion.
]

Eglise
[
	The churches are holy protections are falling, one after an other, but this one stands. We might find a priest inside.
]

Yorick
[
	I can hear the echos of the ring steel makes when it hit bones. One of our man is still fighting there.
]

Fight
[
	The corruption of the city is so advanced we will have to cleanse this place to earn an ever so brief relief.
]

Gate
[
	The bridge was lifted to prevent the contagion. Trying to protect ourselves, we closed our only way to freedom.
]

Key
[
	Here lived the keeper of the Bridge. If God is willing, we will be able to lower it. If God is willing, our salvation is here.

Wood
[
	A wooden watchtower has fallen, blocking the way. A bit of fire and a bit of time could clear enough of the wreckage for us to make it through.
]

Small passage
[
	Some floating debris make a precarious bridge. Maybe someone light enough could walk to the other side, but anyone of normal stature would surely drow.
]

Unholy
[
	Some kind of unholy blight seem to have overtaken this path. Only a holy man could free the way.
]

Camp Fire
[
	A sudden flare of the campfire set the trees ablaze. Walls of flames are closing in on you. The slowest of you won't make it.
]

Forge
[
	It seems the heat has somewhat kept the corruption away. In the forge, you find a red hot iron bar. A unconventionnal weapon to be sure, but a welcome one.
]

Petard
[
	The alchemist used to live in the neighbourhood. Maybe we'll find something useful in the laboratories.
]

Healing fountain
[
	There is a healing fountain there. It probably would be useful to make a halt there.
]

Dispensary
[
	The priests used to heal the poor here. I'm sure there will be some bandages we can use.
]

Isaac
[
	A child is weeping softly in the distance.
]

Camilla
[
	A voice is calling someone. It sounds of despair and frustration.
]

IsaacOrCamilla
[
	A faint voice can be heard crying for someone.
]

Normal
[
	Nothing in sight. Everyone should be safe.
]

Tuto
[
	Even the royal palace has been invaded. I shall fight to protect my people!
]

Palace
[
	My Fate await on this path.
